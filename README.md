# IT2901 TRDK03
This project was completed as part of the course IT2901 Informatics Project II. \
We produce a prototype for an application that visualizes school economics in a
“non-economist” way to better help the principals of Trondheim municipality understand their
budget. We use time series forecasting to predict monthly expenses one year in advance, allowing
better planning and understanding of the yearly economic trends. By allowing continuous data
uploads to better these predictions, we create an application whose usefulness increases over time.
In addition, we use machine learning algorithms to compute similar schools, allowing principals to
study the economy of schools related to their own and learn from each other.
